This project was aimed at understanding the internal communication pattern of the three departments i.e. Data Analytics, Software Engineering and Cyber Security, at Webeet company. 
## Tools
Jupyter notebook, Python, SQL, Tableau
## Usage
The communication_teams.ipynb notebook contains comprehensive analysis code, but requires specific database credentials to execute. While you cannot run this notebook directly with the provided files, the analytical approaches, data processing techniques, and visualization methods can be adapted for similar datasets with appropriate credential configuration. 
## Project structure
Data/: folder contains the final data output that was used to generate a visualization in Tableau.
src/: folder contains .ipynb file that describes how the analysis conducted and active codes that can be executed with appropriate data.
Result/: contains a Tableau generated visualization.
README.md/: A file that contains a highlight about the project.
## Results
* Imported and cleaned 50K+ rows of Slack data directly from GCP using SQL and python scripts, removing null values and duplicates.
* Developed a message classification system where sequential messages within threads were designated as inquiries and replies, with senders mapped to their respective departments and message timestamps used to calculate response times.
* Revealed limited cross-departmental collaboration, highlighting the need for dedicated channels to support collaborative work initiatives.
* Identified evidence of a hierarchical decision-making structure based on communication flow patterns between departments and leadership.
